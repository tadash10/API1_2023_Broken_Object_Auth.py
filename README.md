# API1_2023_Broken_Object_Auth.py

API with Enhanced Security

This is a Python script implementing an API with enhanced security features, including token-based authentication, rate limiting, password hashing, encryption for data storage, and more.
Installation

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Setup

    Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash

pip install bcrypt cryptography PyJWT

    Set your own secret key for the JSON Web Token (JWT) in api.py:

python

SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'

    Set your own encryption key for data source in api.py and data_source.py:

python

# api.py
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'

# data_source.py
self.encryption_key = 'your_encryption_key'

Usage

    User Authentication

To use the API, first, you need to create a User object with a user ID and password. Replace 'your_password' with the actual password for the user in main.py.

python

# main.py
from user import User

# Create a user with user ID and password
authenticated_user = User(user_id=100, password='your_password')

    Create Session Token

Next, create a session token for the authenticated user. This token will be used for subsequent API calls.

python

# main.py
from api import generate_token, SessionManager

# Create a session manager and generate a session token
session_manager = SessionManager()
session_token = session_manager.create_session(authenticated_user)
print("Session Token:", session_token)

    API Function Call

Now, you can make API calls using the api_function_get_object in api.py. Replace session_token and object_id_to_retrieve with actual values.

python

# main.py
from api import api_function_get_object

# Later, when the user makes API requests, you can retrieve the user from the session token
user_from_session = session_manager.get_user_from_session(session_token)
print("User from Session:", user_from_session.user_id)

# API Usage
try:
    object_id_to_retrieve = 1
    result = api_function_get_object(session_token, object_id_to_retrieve)
    print("Object Details:", result)

except PermissionError as e:
    print("PermissionError:", e)

except ValueError as e:
    print("ValueError:", e)

except RuntimeError as e:
    print("RuntimeError:", e)

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)

Security Features

This script includes the following security features:

    Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    Rate limiting to prevent abuse and potential DDoS attacks.
    Password hashing using bcrypt for secure user authentication.
    Data encryption for sensitive data storage using the cryptography library.

Notes

    For a production environment, use stronger secret keys for JWT and encryption, and carefully manage the secrets.
    Always follow best practices for securing your application, such as input validation, output encoding, and regular security reviews.
